API Milestome Project

This is to be a simple search page to gain quick access to information on the MovieDB database.
Quick, Simple and easy to use, should someone want info on a movie they can do a search by title.

UX
Prominant search bar. Auto-focused cursor (to direct attention straight to only interactive part of page)
All info to fit on one page of a computer screen or with easy minimal scrolling on a phone or tablet.
Color scheme to be easy on the eyes and make text stand out.
Ultra simple and easy to read is the key.

Features
Searches will bring back the most relevant answer.
The search result will contain the title, a movie poster, an overview of the movie and the date of release.

future feature. 
This is both a planned future feature and a result of testing; 
While originally to keep things simple, the search only returns one result, there needs to be muliple results
to account for movies that share a title such as reboots.
reviews and a comments section could be on the slate for future versions.
more comprehensive error messaging.

technologies used
bootstrap
Moviedb API

Testing
multiple searches ran
searches ran on devices of different sizes
searches aiming for specific results (this revelaed the flaw that should a movie share a title you will not 
necessarily get the right movie.)
searches that should yeild no results.

Deployment
files have been moved from my old laptop to a new laptop during the process of creating this project.
Pushed to github pages.
